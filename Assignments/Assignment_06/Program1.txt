// Program 1

SOLUTION :-

1. Control flow is here because... a is greater than b 
2. Control flow is here because... a is less than or equal to b
3. Control flow is here because... b is less than c
4. Control flow is here because... b is greater than or equal to c
5. Control flow is here because... c is greater than or equal to a
6. Control flow is here because... c is less than a
