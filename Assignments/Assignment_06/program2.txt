1. Control flow is here because... a is greater than b 
2. Control flow is here because... a is less than b
3. Control flow is here because... a is equal to b 
4. Control flow is here because... b is greater than c
5. Control flow is here because... b is less than c 
6. Control flow is here because... b is equal to c 
7. Control flow is here because... c is greater than a
8. Control flow is here because... c is less than a 
9. Control flow is here because... c is equal to a
10. No the control flow won't reach here.
