SOLUTION :-

1. Control flow is here because... 
   a is equal to b 
   AND
   c is equal to d

2. Control flow is here because...
   a is equal to c  
   AND 
   b is equal to d

3. Control flow is here because...
   a is not equal to c 
   OR 
   c is not equal to d

4. Control flow is here because...
   a is not equal to d 
   AND 
   c is not equal to b 

5. Control flow is here because...
   a is not equal to b OR c is not equal to d
   a is not equal to c AND b is not equal to d
   a is equal to c AND c is equal to d
   a is equal to d OR c is equal to b
