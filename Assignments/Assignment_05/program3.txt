SOLUTION :-

1. Control flow is here because... 
   a is greater than b
   AND
   b is greater than c

2. Control flow is here because... 
   a is greater than b
   AND
   c is greater than a
   
3. Control flow is here because... 
   a is not greater than b
   AND
   c is not greater than a
   
4. Control flow is here because... 
   b is greater than c 
   AND
   c is greater then a 

5. Control flow is here because... 
   b is less than or equal to c 
   OR 
   c is less than or equal to a

6. Control flow is here because... 
   a is not greater than b  OR  b is not greater than c 
   a is not greater than b  OR  c is not greater than a
   a is greater than b      OR  c is greater than a
   b is not greater than c  OR  c is not greater then a 
   b is greater than c      AND   c is greater than a
